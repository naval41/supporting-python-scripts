Following Database_Schema file contains a table schema of different tables. I wanted to send remainder mail to all audience whose Candidate Interview is still in PENDING States. This should be one mail per user with providing access url where they cna complete is "http://roundz.ai/my-interview". Template format you can follow as interview_data_update/email_template/weekly_digest.html. 

Share planning first and before moving to implementation. User email automation folder with current blank file to implement this logic. Also, use common util functions as and when required for email and db
