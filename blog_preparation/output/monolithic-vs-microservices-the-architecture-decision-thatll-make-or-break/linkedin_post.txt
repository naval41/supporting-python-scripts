I just watched a startup burn through $2M because they chose microservices on day one.

Three engineers. Zero users. Twenty-seven different services.

Here's what I learned from watching teams make (and recover from) this architectural decision over the past decade.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴:

Most people think this is a technical decision. It's not. It's a people decision disguised as a technical one.

That startup I mentioned? They spent 8 months building deployment pipelines, service discovery, and distributed tracing. Their competitors shipped features and acquired customers.

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲:

• 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝘀𝗶𝘇𝗲, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀
Small teams (under 10 people) almost always do better with monoliths. You don't have the bandwidth to manage distributed systems complexity. I've seen 3-person teams try to run 15 microservices and it becomes a full-time job just keeping the lights on.

• 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗺𝗽𝘀 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗹𝘀𝗲
Microservices need automated deployments, comprehensive monitoring, distributed tracing, and on-call processes. If you don't have these already, microservices will hurt more than they help. Build these capabilities first, then consider splitting services.

• 𝗗𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀
Don't split services because they "feel" separate. Split them when you have evidence they should be separate. Different scaling needs, different team ownership, different release cycles. Clear business reasons, not just clean code reasons.

• 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝘆𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗱 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝘂𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗶𝗻𝘀
Keep stable, core functionality in a well-structured monolith. Extract services only for new features with unclear requirements or components with genuinely different needs. Most successful companies I've worked with use this pattern.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁: Can you deploy your monolith confidently every day? If not, splitting it into microservices won't magically fix your deployment problems. It'll multiply them.

𝗠𝘆 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:

Start with a monolith, but design it well. Use clear module boundaries and think about how you might split it later. Extract services gradually when you have evidence they should be separate, not just because it feels architecturally pure.

The most successful teams focus on building good software first, then worry about how to structure it.

What's been your experience? Have you seen teams succeed or struggle with either approach? Would love to hear your war stories in the comments.
